                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope
	in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as
	the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as 
	a subspecies.The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the
	current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>
     <p>The Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is the common name given to the largest and most
	 well known of the 3 species of Oryx. Due to their horns being so lethal, Gemsbok
	 have also been called the ‘Sabre Antelope’. Its name is actually derived from 
	 the German word for a male chamois, although they are not related.</p>
   <p>Gemsboks are herbivores and grazers and consume mainly tough dry grasses,
   supplemented with foliage. Desert dwelling gemsbok do not rely on water to
   satisfy their thirst, instead they obtain moisture from tsama melons and by 
   digging up tubers, roots and eating plant bulbs</p>
