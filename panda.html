                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – 
	the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault.
	The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan 
	two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike 
	many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to 
	have medical uses.· Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in 
	the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely
	on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending
	on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist
	bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
     <p>In other words, even though the panda has a diet like a herbivore,
	 its insides more closely resemble a carnivore. This is why they must 
	 eat such a vast quantity of the plant to survive. And the reason why 
	 the giant panda is officially classified as a carnivore. I hope that
	 what I shared has given you a deeper appreciation of the amazing giant panda!
