                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>The koala is an iconic Australian animal.
	Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a 
	marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.
	Though koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool
	of a sheep. They have two opposing thumbs on their hands, and both 
	their feet and hands have rough pads and claws to grab onto branches. 
      </p>
     <p>Koalas are well-known for their large round head, big furry ears
	 and big black nose. Their fur is usually grey-brown in colour with white
	 fur on the chest, inner arms, ears and bottom. They have no fur on their 
	 nose or the palms of their paws. Koalas have particularly hard bottoms,
	 which is similar to their closest relative, the wombat. For the koala, 
	 this feature enables them to wedge comfortably in tree forks for long periods
	 of time, whereas the wombat uses its hard bottom as a defence mechanism.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E24, right next to the giraffes.</p>
